An array of *Tiles* ; Each tile would have an associated texture (and possibly a path to that texture), and would then be used as reference to assemble tile according to the *Tilemap* (via pointers).

Tilemap::
An array of *Tiles* that has an associated width and height values denoting the total number of tiles in the map (widtx * height)

Starting Point::
*Point* {int x,y}; Could be multiple starting points in the future e.g. vector< *Point* >; would select randomly from all the *Points* in the array;

== basic rendering 2
* [ ] come up with architecture to keep and call textures
* [ ] implement first version of level files.
* [ ] create a test level e.g. Ign Alazur - The Ancient Library. Should at least have floor and wall tiles, a few columns/pillars would be good as well.
** [ ] a couple different tiles
** [ ] a couple different walls
** [ ] a pillar or two
* [ ] render the test-level

== mop up
* [ ] review and refactor changes
* [ ] plan further

== a basic arena for testing rules, etc.
* [ ] implement a basic character
* [ ] implement a basic mob
* [ ] implement first iteration of the movement and combat rules, and play around with that a bit

== containers
* [ ] lockable containers and items to unlock containers
* [ ] picking locks (think how to approach this, as we need both - a usable skills system and a usable magic system in place), maybe move to another milestone
** [ ] via lock-picking skill
** [ ] via magic

== moving around
* [ ] pathfinding
* [ ] doors
* [ ] lock-able doors, locking and unlocking doors
** [ ] magic that changes character material properties (turn to smoke, water, incorporeal, etc)
** [ ] teleportation spells
** [ ] magical barriers
** [ ] magic dampners, null-magic zones, traps that react to magic casting (e.g. thaumaturgic parasite swarm :D), etc.

== stealth
* [ ] stealth

== 2018-08-15
additional plot elements

== [x] buttons 2018-08-14
* [x] textures
* [x] programming

== [x] basic rendering 2018-03-13
* [x] the basic input-update-display loop
* [x] framerate capping
** [x] implement time duration registering at nanosecond resolution
** [x] implement pauses at nanosecond resolution.
* [x] read and store pixel data from png
* [x] conjure a way to keep and pass tile textures efficiently.
* [x] implement efficient text printing via the texture-atlas method, monospaced font would be quite enough for now, but design keeping in mind a future update to both mono and variable spaced fonts.
